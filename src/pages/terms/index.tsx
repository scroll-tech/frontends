        Scroll Foundation (“Scroll Foundation”, “we,” “us,” or “our”), currently provides a website-hosted user interface that can be accessed at
        <LinkStyled href="/bridge"> https://scroll.io/bridge</LinkStyled> (the “Interface”) for accessing, and certain information about, Scroll
        network, a layer-2 protocol that scales Ethereum (“Scroll”), as well as related content about Scroll and functionality through websites
        located at <LinkStyled href="/"> https://scroll.io</LinkStyled>, which includes{" "}
        <LinkStyled href="/bridge"> https://scroll.io/bridge</LinkStyled>, <LinkStyled href="/portal"> https://scroll.io/portal</LinkStyled> (each, a
        “Site” and collectively, the “Sites”). We also currently provide access and information about Scroll through our related technologies,
        including all of our existing and any updated or new features, functionalities and technologies (the Interface and all such features,
        functionalities and technologies, collectively, the “Service”).

                <strong>Access to the Service and Sites; Your Apps. </strong> You may only access or use the Service and Sites or accept the Terms if
                you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you have received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to
                use the Service or Site and have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to the Terms on your behalf). If you are agreeing to the
                Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to the Terms on that
                organization’s or entity’s behalf and bind them to the Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in the Terms, except
                for in this sentence and in the paragraph directly above, refer to that organization or entity). You are responsible for maintaining
                the confidentiality of your credentials and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your credentials.
              </p>
              <p>
                As between Scroll Foundation and you, you will be solely responsible for your applications (“Your Apps”), including their development,
                operation, maintenance and all related content and materials.

                <strong>License; Open Source Components. </strong>
                Subject to these Terms, you are hereby granted a non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use and access the
                Sites and the Service solely for your own personal, non-commercial use, subject to the following restrictions: (a) you shall not
                license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Service or Sites, whether in
                whole or in part, or any content displayed on the Service or Sites; and (b) you shall not modify, make derivative works of,
                disassemble, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of the Service or Sites. All copyright and other proprietary notices on the
                Service and Sites (or on any content displayed on the Service or Sites) must be retained on all copies thereof.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted above, certain software components underlying Scroll are made available under separate open source licenses, such as the MIT
                License and other open source licenses. You agree not to violate the terms of any such open source licenses. In the event of a
                conflict between the license granted to you in these Terms and any separate licenses for any software components underlying Scroll,
                the separate license will prevail with respect to the software that is the subject of the separate license.

              <p>
                <strong>The Interface. </strong>
                The Interface facilitates your ability to access Scroll, but the Interface is distinct from Scroll. It provides one, but not the
                exclusive, means of accessing Scroll. Scroll is public, permissionless, and runs on open-source self-executing smart contracts. Scroll
                enables people to do various things, such as processing Ethereum transactions more efficiently and interacting with smart
                contract-based applications (“dApps”). The Interface, on the other hand, enables you to initiate messages to Scroll to bridge digital
                assets between the Ethereum and Scroll public blockchains.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong> Your Use of Wallets. </strong>
                To access the Interface or other components of the Service, you must use non-custodial wallet software (a “Web3 wallet”), which
                constructs and broadcasts the data (“transactions”) that allows you to interact with Scroll. By using your Web3 wallet in connection
                with accessing the Interface or other components of the Service, you agree that you are using the Web3 wallet under the terms and
                conditions of the applicable provider of the Web3 wallet. No Web3 wallet is created by, operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with
                us. Accordingly, we do not have custody or control over the contents of your Web3 wallet and we have no ability to retrieve or
                transfer its contents. Your relationship with any given Web3 wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that
                third party, not these Terms.

            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Assumption of risk. </strong>
                By using the Service or any Sites, you (a) represent that you are sophisticated enough to understand the various inherent risks of
                using cryptographic and public blockchain-based systems, including but not limited to the Interface and other components of the
                Service, Scroll, and digital assets, and (b) acknowledge and accept all such risks, and agree that we make no representations or
                warranties (expressly or implicitly) regarding, and that you will not hold us liable for those risks, including but not limited to the
                risks described below, any or all of which could lead to losses and damages, including the total and irrevocable loss of your assets.
                These risks include, but are not limited to:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Wallet security and safekeeping. </strong>
                      You are solely responsible for the safeguarding and security of your Web3 wallets. If you lose your wallet seed phrase, private
                      keys, or password, you may be forever unable to access your digital assets. Any unauthorized access to your wallet by third
                      parties could result in the loss or theft of your digital assets. We have no involvement in, or responsibility for, storing,
                      retaining, securing or recovering your Web3 wallet seed phrases, private keys, or passwords, or for any unauthorized access to
                      your Web3 wallet.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Blockchain technology. </strong>
                      Public blockchains, and the technology underlying and interacting with cryptographic and public blockchain-based systems, are
                      experimental, inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to a
                      particular public blockchain (e.g., via forks) could disrupt these technologies irreparably. There is no guarantee that any of
                      these technologies will not become unavailable, degraded, or subject to hardware or software errors, operational or technical
                      difficulties, denial-of-service attacks, other cyberattacks, or other problems requiring maintenance, interruptions, delays, or
                      errors.

                      <strong>Network cost and performance. </strong>
                      The cost, speed, and availability of transacting on public blockchain systems are subject to significant variability. There is
                      no guarantee that any transfer will be confirmed or transferred successfully.
                    </p>

                      <strong>Blockchain transactions and smart contract execution. </strong>
                      Public blockchain-based transactions (including but not limited to transactions automatically executed by smart contracts) are
                      generally considered irreversible when confirmed. Any transaction that will interact with smart contracts or be recorded on a
                      public blockchain must be recorded with extreme caution.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Digital assets. </strong>
                      The markets for digital assets are nascent and highly volatile due to various risk factors including (but not limited to)
                      adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. Digital assets and their underlying blockchain networks are complex
                      emerging technologies that may be subject to delays, halts or go offline as a result of errors, forks, attacks or other
                      unforeseeable reasons. Anyone can create a digital asset, including fake versions of existing digital assets and digital assets
                      that falsely claim to represent projects. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be fully or
                      adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs. You are solely responsible for understanding the risks
                      specific to each digital asset that is relevant to you.

                      <strong>Cyber Security. </strong>
                      In addition to being an especially novel and untested implementation of blockchain technology in general, cross-blockchain
                      bridging technology and other blockchain related technology has historically been, and may in the future be, the subject of
                      numerous cyberattacks and exploits, including without limitation hacks that exploit a vulnerability in the associated software,
                      hardware, systems or other equipment or social engineering to gain control of the any bridge or other blockchain-related
                      components, wallets, smart contracts or other related systems.

                      <strong>Control of Scroll. </strong>
                      Scroll is subject to periodic upgrades, which may introduce other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattack vectors, or other
                      changes to Scroll that could disrupt the operation of the Interface or other components of the Service, the functionality of
                      bridging, your ability to access bridged digital assets, or otherwise cause you damage or loss.

                      <strong>Third Party Risks. </strong>
                      Third-party products (including dApps) carry their own individual, often times highly significant risks. When you use the
                      Interface to interact with any third-party products, you are subject to all of those risks. We disclaim all risk arising from
                      the acts and omissions of any third party, including any third party with whom you transact or interact with using the Service.
                      We are not responsible for confirming the identity of or overseeing any third party with whom you may interact using the

                      We may suspend or terminate your use of the Service if you or any of your assets are subject to legal process or other
                      encumbrance restricting any transaction or your use of the Service, and to address and investigate any suspicious activity we
                      identify in connection with your use of the Service. We may comply with any such legal process. We may, but are not required to,
                      request that you provide information and documentation regarding your identity and assets in order to use the Service.

                      Digital assets, blockchain technology, and any related software and services are subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty in
                      many jurisdictions. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions may adversely affect the usage, transferability,
                      transactability and accessibility of digital assets, bridging, Scroll, or the Interface or other components of the Service.

                <strong>Arbitration. </strong>
