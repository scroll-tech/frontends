# A Letter from Scroll: Mainnet is Here!

![scroll mainnet live](/imgs/homepage/blog/founderLetter/scroll_mainnet_live.png)

To our community,

Scroll was founded in 2021 with the mission to scale Ethereum. After three successful testnets spanning over 15 months with extensive testing and rigorous security audits, we are thrilled to announce that Scroll Mainnet has officially launched for everyone to use. As we open the doors to Mainnet, we want to take a moment to reflect on our journey thus far.

### Starting With Research

Scroll was established by Ethereum enthusiasts and open-source contributors dedicated to advancing zero-knowledge proofs. Our research into enhancing prover efficiency yielded the first [ASIC paper ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9499783)and a [GPU prototype](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3575693.3575711). Coupled with advancements in proving systems, we observed a large improvement in prover efficiency. This breakthrough led to our work on the zkEVM, a scaling solution nearly identical to Ethereum with lower cost, faster speed and limitless scaling potential. We shared our nascent insights on Ethereum’s [research forum](https://ethresear.ch/t/introducing-scroll-a-new-layer2-solution/9186), marking the true beginning of Scroll's journey.

### Growing in the Open

As Scroll evolved, we stayed true to our academic roots, channeling our passion into building. Scroll grew up in the playground of the open source community; we were fortunate to collaborate with some of the finest researchers and most skilled engineers to build our zkEVM. Uniquely, our zkEVM has been open-source from day one, crafted in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation’s PSE team and a community of individual collaborators. We continuously upstreamed our code in a [shared repository](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits), driven by common objectives and a dedication to open-source values.

### Focusing on Developer Experience

We believe scaling solutions must meet developers and users where they are, and there is no ecosystem more vibrant than Ethereum’s, where developers are accustomed to building with the open-source tooling purpose-built for this community. By offering an EVM-compatible solution, we allow a seamless experience for existing applications and developer tooling to migrate from Ethereum to Scroll. Everything functions right out of the box. Currently, we support all EVM opcodes, including the recently added PUSH0 (with the exception of the soon-to-be deprecated SELFDESTRUCT) and six precompiles, such as ecPairing, enabling developers to deploy zk applications on Scroll. Furthermore, by utilizing the widely adopted Geth codebase, we minimize deviations from Ethereum. This deepens compatibility for nodes and simplifies the adoption of diverse clients.

### Security Over Optics

At Scroll, our commitment to security is uncompromising and has guided all of our decisions. Our code is grounded in battle-tested cryptographic libraries such as halo2, while being reviewed regularly by community members. Internally, we operate both blue and red security teams dedicated to uncovering potential vulnerabilities. Recognizing the importance of objective assessments from external parties, we engaged four esteemed firms for comprehensive external audits. Our bridge and rollup contracts were audited by OpenZeppelin and Zellic; the zkEVM circuits were reviewed by Trail of Bits, Zellic, and KALOS, and the node implementation was analyzed by Trail of Bits. To make security even more robust, we are launching a well-funded bug bounty program on the Immunefi platform.

### Progress Through Testnets

Our focus on developer experience and security was not purely theoretical. In the 15 months since our initial release, our sequence of testnets has allowed us to continuously refine Scroll alongside our community. Throughout this time, we closely monitored and learned from the following milestones:

- Over 450K smart contracts deployed
- 90M+ total transactions
- An average of 305K transactions per day
- Production of 9M+ blocks
- Generation of 280K ZK proofs

Our testnets have allowed us to approach the Mainnet release with the attention to detail and caution necessary to ensure its success. This time also gave us the opportunity to more clearly carve out our place in the broader Ethereum ecosystem and to voice our values to the public. We will continue to operate our most recent testnet, [Scroll Sepolia](https://scroll.io/blog/scrollSepolia), as a testing ground for all upgrades to our Mainnet.

A Global Effort

Over the past year, we have actively encouraged developers around the world to experiment on Scroll. By globally supporting grassroots events, hosting developer-centric workshops, and organizing ZK research education, radical and transformative ideas are emerging that we once could only imagine. We aim to continue fostering a wide array of innovative applications while minimizing costs for experimentation. As the community expands, we are heartened by the increasing collaborative contributions that will cater to the next billion users.

Our team is distributed across 26 countries, with a footprint covering every populated continent. While this has made development and coordination in some ways more logistically challenging, we intentionally structured our team this way to engage with local communities globally. Embracing a variety of identities and backgrounds allows us to achieve more meaningful levels of social consensus and reach a broader audience.

Commitment to Community

Our mission transcends purely technological advancement; we cherish the spirit of Ethereum just as deeply as its security that we inherit. As our community blossoms, our core values remain steadfast: unwavering commitment to technical rigor, dedication to research and technology, warmth in our interactions, openness to being challenged, and a commitment to credible neutrality. We are shaping the future with our community, seeking to encourage collaboration rather than dominance in a zero-sum game. Our vision for the ecosystem is to be like Ethereum’s "infinite garden" where we can nurture and cultivate as gardeners, allowing for healthy, organic growth.

In this light, we welcome you to begin your journey on our Mainnet.
