# Contribute to Scroll

_Written by Daniel Helm ([@dghelm](https://twitter.com/dghelm))._

Open-source contributions are one of the most important cornerstones of the digital age. The world runs on open source, from Linux to Docker and thousands of other projects, driven by a community of developers who contribute their skills and expertise. At Scroll, we firmly believe in the power of community and are thrilled to introduce our new initiative: Contribute to Scroll.

At some point around ETHDenver this year, after months of warring and memes about “the first zkEVM,” many of us working on Scroll wanted to emphasize what we thought mattered most — being the _**community-first zkEVM**_. We recognize that the community aspect of open source is vital for the growth and adoption of Ethereum and its entire ecosystem, Scroll included. With this in mind, we are excited to launch Contribute to Scroll, a repository that encourages open collaboration and the integration of Scroll with various developer tools and projects.

In the Contribute to Scroll repository, we invite everyone to suggest their ideas and shape the future of Scroll by taking a look at the open issues. While the current focus is on adding Scroll to developer tooling and exploring experimental projects we call "skunkworks," this is just the beginning. We have big plans for the future, with many more exciting initiatives in the pipeline.

We encourage you to check out the repository and see if any suggested integrations spark your interest. Some of these integrations may require as little as 10 minutes. Your contribution could have a significant impact on the development and growth of Scroll. [The Contribute to Scroll repo can be found here.](https://github.com/scroll-tech/contribute-to-scroll)

## Rewarding Contributors

At Scroll, we value and appreciate the efforts of those who contribute to our ecosystem. Thanks to our friends at GitPOAP, we are able to acknowledge and reward contributors. This initiative is just the start, as we envision Scroll as a truly community-built and community-owned project. In the coming months, you can expect more of our repositories to be refactored to promote open collaboration by emphasizing comprehensive documentation and modularity to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with Scroll.

If you are eager to join the builder community around Scroll but don't find anything that particularly excites you, you can still contribute by suggesting another idea. Better yet, gather some collaborators, or keep an eye out for our upcoming documentation initiatives and protocol code refactors. Contribute to Scroll is a testament to our shared vision of building the future of open source technology together, and we invite you to be part of the vibrant community shaping the future.
