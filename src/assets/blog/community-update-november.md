# Community Update: November

### Early Mainnet Statistics

- [Over 26,000 batches have been committed and finalized on L1 Ethereum.](https://scroll.io/rollupscan?page=1&per_page=10)
- [More than 5,900,000 transactions have been executed on Scroll Mainnet.](https://scrollscan.com/)
- [Scroll Mainnet has attracted over $48,000,000 in TVL.](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/scroll)

### Technical Improvements

**Bridging Costs:** We have implemented several advanced technical optimizations to significantly reduce the cost of bridging funds onto Scroll. To further this effort, we are designing Scroll’s “batch compression” feature, which will unlock further efficiency by reducing the amount of gas it costs to commit each batch to L1 Ethereum.

**EVM-Compatibility:** Our engineering team has made substantial progress in enabling the SHA2-256 precompile and implementing EIP-1559, Ethereum’s upgraded fee mechanism. These upgrades significantly boost Scroll’s overall compatibility with Ethereum, unlocking a more comprehensive range of new possibilities across DeFi, GameFi, and everything in between.

**Security:** With the end goal of complete decentralization in mind, we are slowly beginning to remove Scroll’s training wheels. We are now designing an enforced batch mechanism that will ensure that user funds can always be recovered in the unlikely event of a long-lasting sequencer failure. To improve our security over the short term, we have optimized Scroll’s chain-monitor component to make it more robust. This optimization allows us to short-circuit batch finalization in the unlikely case of an ongoing exploit.

**Robustness and UX:** With UX as a core focus, we are refactoring the Scroll bridge backends to provide a superior experience for Scroll users. One of the main features of this UX upgrade is the ability to see much more detailed information about failing transactions.

### Scroll Community Meetups

Part of Scroll’s journey is to foster relationships and growth across all parts of the globe, onboarding builders and users to propel the growth of our earliest community supporters. Scroll Community Meetups is a worldwide initiative for Scroll to provide support of up to $1,000 USD for developer community organizers and those who wish to host gatherings to educate local communities about Scroll and our mission.

### Scroll at Devconnect 🇹🇷

Now that Devconnect 2023 has come to a close, it is only fitting that we take some time to pause and reflect on what was one of the most amazing Ethereum events of the year.

Over the seven days we spent in Istanbul, Scroll participated in more than 30 events, hosting presentations, participating in panel discussions, and supporting builders at numerous hacker events throughout the city. Our Developer Relations team was out in full force, supporting builders at events such as [zkHack](https://twitter.com/__zkhack__), [L3 Summit](https://twitter.com/L3_Summit), ZuConnect, Builder Nights, and the Istanbul Hacker Club. We hosted numerous educational workshops at these events to help guide and support the next generation of Ethereum builders.

In addition to the main event, the Scroll team hosted the very first L2DAYS, held in collaboration with L2beat. With a jam-packed agenda that spanned two full days, L2DAYS was the largest individual event at Devconnect, attracting some of the brightest minds in the space to bring together builders, researchers, and enthusiasts who all share a collective passion for the development of Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap. 

We understand that many of you reading this may not have had the opportunity to attend the in-person event, so we recorded every main stage talk across both days. You can find both [days one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsUC0jZzP8E) and [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsUC0jZzP8E) on our official [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Scroll_ZKP/streams).

### ETH Global Istanbul 🛠️

As part of our community-building efforts in Turkey, we were proud supporters and sponsors of the 2023 ETH Global Hackathon in Istanbul. We were blown away by the levels of support for this year’s event and were proud to see that more than 160 out of the total 427 teams who registered for the event chose to build on Scroll.

To support the effort of our early ecosystem builders, we awarded multiple teams a share in our $17,000 prize pool, spanning across two categories. The top ten winners from our ‘Best on Scroll’ track have been listed below - see [here](https://ethglobal.com/showcase?events=istanbul) for our complete list of winners.
