# Community Update: October

Welcome to Scrollâ€™s October community update, where we unpack some of our latest technical advancements and breakthroughs made by our engineering team over the past month.

### Mainnet Updates

### Scroll Mainnet is Here!

After over two years of building, we successfully launched the Scroll zkEVM on Ethereum mainnet. Scroll mainnet is open to all developers and users and can be seamlessly accessed through our simple [bridge UI](https://scroll.io/bridge).

For more information on our mainnet launch, we published a [blog post](https://scroll.io/blog/founderLetter) reflecting on our journey so far and includes all the relevant details you will need to get started today.

### Security Measures

Throughout our pre-launch phase, we battle-tested Scroll over three consecutive testnets to ensure that Scroll Mainnet upholds the highest security standards and is safe for everyone. In addition to our own internal auditing, we collaborated with four auditing firms, including [OpenZeppelin](https://twitter.com/OpenZeppelin), [Zellic](https://twitter.com/zellic_io), [Trail of Bits](https://twitter.com/trailofbits), and [Kalos Security](https://twitter.com/kalos_security).

For a comprehensive report on our internal and external auditing phases, check out our official [blog post](https://scroll.io/blog/scrolls-security-measures) that outlines our security practices in further detail.

### Our \$1,000,000 Bug Bounty on Immunefi

As security remains our top priority, we have launched a [\$1,000,000 bug bounty on Immunfei](https://immunefi.com/bounty/scroll/) to encourage security researchers and auditors from our community to help ensure that Scroll continues to be battle-tested as much as possible following our mainnet launch. Additionally, our Co-Founder Haichen Shen joined ImmuneFi for a [Twitter Space](https://x.com/Scroll_ZKP/status/1715061502699532589?s=20) to discuss our bounty program's details.

Below is a framework that lists the rewards for different tiers of identified vulnerabilities:

- **Critical**: up to \$1,000,000.00
- **High**: \$10,000.00 - \$50,000.00
- **Medium**: \$5,000.00

### Smart Contract Deployment Tutorials

To help support our early ecosystem builders, Raza and Ahmed from our Developer Relations team put together several video tutorials to guide developers on deploying different types of smart contracts on Scroll Mainnet.
