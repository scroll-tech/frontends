# Announcing the Scroll Alpha Testnet on Goerli

Just a few years ago, zkEVMs were entirely theoretical, existing solely in research forums and whitepapers due to their significant proving overhead and circuit complexity. However, with the combined effort of researchers in the zk space, huge improvements to proof systems, circuit design, and acceleration have made zkEVMs practical.

For nearly two years, we’ve focused our efforts on building a bytecode-compatible zkEVM in the open alongside the Privacy and Scaling Explorations team and other open source contributors. A zkEVM is no easy feat, and it has taken a lot of effort and progress to get to where we are today. Throughout this process, we have adhered to our values:

- **Community-driven:** The open source ethos allows efforts to compound over time as we collectively iterate upon cryptographic primitives together and harness their power for practical applications.
- **Long-term thinking:** zkEVMs are one of the most complex systems that leverage blockchains, and it is imperative that a system this intricate is built safely, securely, and with a long-term vision in mind. A feature-complete, battle-tested zkEVM is a multi-year process and must be built with rigorous standards.
- **Adherence to Ethereum’s values:** Ethereum is the gold standard of blockchains for good reason. Rollups should eventually extend Ethereum in all aspects, including decentralization and resilience.

In August 2022, we launched our Pre-Alpha testnet, supported by our community of over 100,000 users. To date, we’ve processed over 15,400,000 transactions and proved 1,800,000 blocks. Over 641,000 batches have been submitted as validity proofs and finalized by our rollup contract on L1.

Today, we are thrilled to announce that our Alpha testnet is now live on Goerli, marking a pivotal moment in the development of Scroll. Our deployment is completely permissionless, allowing anyone to experiment with our technology and push it to its limits.

Our feature set is [transparent](https://hackmd.io/@haichen/ryukZaYAs), and we’re committed to iterating and improving the performance of our zkEVM over the coming months. We’re excited to continue working alongside our strong community of open source contributors to build a future where blockchains will power the applications of tomorrow.
