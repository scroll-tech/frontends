## Scrollâ€™s Fresh Coat: A Community Touch

#### Discover our updated website and developer portal, shaped by collective insights and collaboration
Scrollers, we're thrilled to unveil our fresh new look! But first, let's delve into why this transformation is happening. 

Scroll was born from a small collective of dedicated contributors, united by the vision of scaling Ethereum for the billions of people who have yet to onboard and fostering an exceptional developer experience. Fast-forward three years, and we've evolved into a global, decentralized movement with hundreds of thousands of people tracking our journey. 

Through interactions at hackathons, events, and various engagements around the globe, we've gathered invaluable insights from our diverse community. Many voiced a desire for a contemporary update to our logo, colors, and overall experience. Taking these suggestions to heart, we have evolved our visual identity to better reflect our core values. 

### The new Scroll:

### Our Imagery: 
The depicted human figures represent our family of builders and users hailing from the far corners of the world. Drawing inspiration from the earthy hues of ancient sandstone, our color palette blends these rich tones with vibrant splashes symbolizing growth and innovation. We have featured these images prominently on the website and other public content, hoping to inspire more people to join our dynamic and expanding community.

### New Elements in Motion:
Recognizing the reality that millions around the world possess smartphones without access to computers, we have now tailored our updates for both mobile and desktop users. Across every page of our website, you'll find enhanced accessibility to information about our ecosystem, contributors, core beliefs, and a simplified route to bridge assets onto Scroll.

Each page features substantial improvements to enhance user experience, a direct response to the evolving needs of our community. Check out our [website](https://scroll.io/) and [developer portal](https://https://docs.scroll.io/en/home/) to get a sample!
