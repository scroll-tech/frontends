# Announcing the Scroll Origins NFT

---

### Mainnet is Here and it’s Time to Build!

After launching three successful testnets, we are ready for developers and protocols to deploy their contracts and explore Scroll’s newly launched [Mainnet](https://scroll.io/blog/founderLetter). To commemorate this moment, we are launching [Scroll Origins](https://scroll.io/developer-nft/check-eligibility), an NFT mint to celebrate Scroll’s earliest builders. This makes a permanent onchain record that you were here with us at this critical moment.

### Scroll Values

Scroll’s Ethereum-aligned values have guided our decisions to be open-source, community-driven, and credibly neutral from day one. There are many ways to grow an ecosystem, but Scroll’s aim is to grow community organically, creating equal opportunities for everyone to build, learn, and grow in Web3. We envision the Scroll Origins NFT as a symbol of recognition for Scroll’s early builders, a link that bonds the Scroll community, and a reminder of what is possible when we build and collaborate together.

### More Than Just an Image

In our endeavor to craft a distinctive NFT, we set out to create a visual embodiment of Scroll's commitment to zero knowledge principles. The NFT features a Scroll-themed background, encompassed by a dynamic polynomial equation. The distinct polynomial present in each NFT epitomizes the complex mathematical foundations that are crucial for generating and verifying various zero-knowledge proofs. Such proofs are at the heart of Scroll zkEVM's functionality.

These curves, with their unique inflection points, are generated based on the deployment stage and metadata of the underlying contract. The Metadata captures:

1. First deployment date
2. Order of deployment (i.e., the first contract deployed post-Mainnet is denoted as ‘1’)
3. Deployment address
4. Initial deployed contract transaction hash
5. Additional surprises for contracts that are exceptional (e.g., liquidity, interaction, complexity, etc.)

No two NFTs will be identical, and they all encapsulate both Scroll’s technological legacy and ongoing journey.

### **Technical Execution**

We look forward to sharing the underlying details of the function generation on claim day. Stay tuned.
